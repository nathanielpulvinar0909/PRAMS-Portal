# PRAMS Portal

The PRAMS (Pasig River Automated Monitoring System) Portal is a comprehensive platform designed for monitoring and managing water quality in the Pasig River. It leverages automated data collection and integrates the Water Quality Index (WQI) to provide accurate, real-time insights. The portal is built using modern web technologies to ensure efficiency and scalability.

## Key Features

- **Automated Monitoring**: Continuous data collection from sensors deployed in the Pasig River.
- **Water Quality Index Integration**: Real-time computation and display of WQI metrics.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a sleek and responsive design.
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Allows users to view and analyze data based on their requirements.
- **Secure and Scalable**: Developed with Next.js and TypeScript for robust performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript**: For improved code quality and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Ensures a responsive and modern user interface.

## Project Structure

The portal is organized into the following directories:

- **`src/app`**: Core application files.
  - **`assets`**: Static assets like images and fonts.
  - **`components`**: Reusable UI components.
  - **`pages`**: Page-level components for routing.
  - **`services`**: API integrations and service utilities.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
